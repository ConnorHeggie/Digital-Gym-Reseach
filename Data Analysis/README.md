# Digital-Gym-Reseach
Working repository for the Digital Gym project in the Scalable Health Initiative.


Rice Digital Gym project is turning Rice gym into a massive health sensor. The Digital Gym will serve as a foundation to measure how exercise impacts the wellness and health of a whole community, in this case, the Rice community. To convert the gym into a massive sensor, we are developing mountables. Mountables can be mounted on any gym equipment or gym space, and will convert  “analog” equipment/spaces to “networked digital” gym equipment/spaces.

The project is part of Rice Scalable Labs, and partially funded by NSF VIP.
